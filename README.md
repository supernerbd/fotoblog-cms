# fotoblog-cms

This fotoblog CMS is based on Parse cloud solutions. Unfortunately Parse is closing down next January. 
Because of that I stopped the development. 

The backend of this CMS lets me upload picture and
automatically reads the meta-data of the images. So I don't need to fill in data like the F-Number or Exposure Time per hand. Moreover the
pictures are processed after uploading making several versions for different client resolutions.The frontend is responsive and shows the
images and corresponding meta-data. An automatic slideshow is possible and the user can scroll through the pictures by using key left or
key right. 

You can visit the app (until January 2017) [here](http://onedoteight.parseapp.com/).
